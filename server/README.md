# ‚≠ê The Prime Network: Server

**To be a part of the official game, there is no need for this directory. If you would like to create your own game, clone this directory.**

## Installation
`npm install`

Edit the configuration options at the top of `app.js` to manage your port and settings.

Run `node app.js` to start the server. 

## Making a Client Page
You can copy the `/client` directory, but keep in mind that you may need to change the IP / Port in `backend.js`, as it's set by default to `localhost:4013`.
