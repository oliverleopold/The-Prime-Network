# ‚≠ê The Prime Network

The Prime Network is a game where participants use their computer to find prime numbers, and are awarded points based on how many primes they find.

##Use
You can play easily at https://oliverleopold.com/prime. No programming knowledge neccessary.

##Blocks
A block is a range of 1,000 numbers. At any time, a client can request a block from the server and start working. Once the client has found all of the prime numbers inside the block, they will return it to the server. After a block is first submitted, it stays open for 24-hours. Once it closes, a correct answer will be determined based on the majority answer.

The first person to have submitted the correct answer will recieve 85% of the primes as points. The second will recieve 5%, the third will recieve 2%, and all other correct answers will share the remaining 8%.

The server generates blocks, and tries to have at least 300 open blocks at any given time, but will open up to 1,000 blocks at a time based on the current amount of traffic.
